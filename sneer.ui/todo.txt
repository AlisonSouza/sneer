[Sneer is not test-driven. It is GUI-driven and test-verified.]

============ FIX:

Contacts' online status changes are not being detected. (make isOnline a reactive Signal))

============ TODO:

Profile
  - Profile Info
  - Contact Info
  - Large photograph

Use less bandwidth (push instead of poll (use reactive paradigm) for everything).

Refactor: Move Contact to Sneer (facade). Make GUI truly only a skin.

Notifications -	Level 2 contact "WhatsHisNickname>Nickname" is now sovereign

Server Port - Allow change. MUST WORK WITHOUT RESTART.  ;)

Milestone: Sneer is Presentable -------------------------

Snapshots - prevayler.takeSnapshot()

Messages
  - Make messaging private

Top Ten plugin
  - User defined categories
  - File Rating for ED2K links (Sharereactor-like)

Trust Metric

Photograph sharing.


Consider XML-RPC

Disk sharing
  - Simple file replication
  - Encryption

Installer
  - Milestone: Sneer downloadable -----------------------

Bandwidth sharing/management
  - Quotas by Priority
    - Priority Zero (Ex: Voice, chat, games, etc (+ X% priority One))
    - Priority One (Ex: interactive apps, etc (+ Y% priority Two))
    - Priority Two (Downloads, etc (+ Z% priority Three))

CPU sharing
  - Fault-tolerance
  - Load Balancing
    - Automated test distribution
    - 3D rendering

Better refresh algorithm for the ContactsView (try to only update the changed elements)

Google Earth awareness
  - Top Ten restaurants close by
  - Where are my friends?
