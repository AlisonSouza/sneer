MAIN ROADMAP
===================
	- [Kalecser] Continuous Integration with Clover test coverage
	- [Bamboo] configure svn diff max-length
	- [Sandro] Fix SneerFreedom7Test
	- Output folders - Why do wheel and the kernel have to go to a different output folder (API-bin) than the default (bin)?
		- Consider using "brick-bin" for bricks and bin for all the rest because bricks something different by nature. 
	- ASM - Move asm*.jar to a brick lib
		- Remove kernel dependency. Make it pluggable in the kernel.
	- XStream - Revise its need and presence in wheel.
	- Revise entire project structure
		
		- Sneer
			- Installer
			- Wheel (+ Commons)
			- Boot (+ KernelJockey)
			- Kernel
			- Pulp (Bricks)
			- Skin (Bricks)
		- Snapps (Bricks)
			- ...
		
		- Move or delete stuff we have not yet covered in the roadmap
			- [done] Example: Delete GiveNTake
		- Delete all empty folders
	- Remove log4j warnings on System.err
	- Package names in LOWER CASE - rename pascal case packages to lower case. (Ask Klaus why)
	- Replace the AnnotatedFieldInjector by the StaticFieldInjector - Need to create our own TestRunner?
		- Load wheel in a base classloader that also adds "implements Serializable" to classes.
	- Refactor AbstractSwingMenu.addAction and the SelectableAction hierarchy. Too many casts. 
	- Tray Icon - Ask Petra for a 16x16 icon to put there. Black on white. No transparency.
	- Revise SneerFreedom*Test classes. All are the same
	- Revise task comments in the code: Fix Urgent, Fix, Implement, Refactor.
	- Brick Publish
	- Contact List - (Host addresses for Sneer developers are HARDCODED)
		- Name
		- Online indicator icon
	---------------------------------- FIRST DOGFOOD RELEASE
	- Logging API
	- Blinking lights
		- API
		- Snapp
	- Transparent Persistence
	- Wind
	- Voice Calls - Already done in old sneermonolith project
	- Screen Viewing à la VNC - There is a free vnc client implementation in Java. If there is no free server implementation in java, just send the entire screen over using gzip compression for now.
    - File Transfer
	- Traffic Prioritization by tuple type
    - MSN Client
    	- Contact Unification
	- Messaging - Grand unification of instant messages and email
		- Instant Messaging
		- Offline Messaging (equivalent to "email")
		- Group Messages
		- History
	- Wind History
    - File Sharing
    	- Public Files
	- Brick
		- Uninstall
		- Update
	- Kernel Update
		- Auto Update
	- Contact CRUD
		- Nicknames
	- MeToo
	- Security
		- Sandboxing
	- Responsive threading model for snapps. Snapps can NEVER block the Swing gui thread. Maybe have one event dispatch thread per Snapp. Snapps still have to comply with invokeLater/invokeAndWait to modify gui from other threads or live with the consequences. Test to see if they can ruin/interfere with the entire Sneer gui even having acess to their own components. 
	- Affinity
		- Access control to all other snapps by affinity.
	- Authentication (PK)
	- Issue Tracking
	- Revise project structure - sourcefolders, package names, build.xml, etc

	- Own Photo - Crop
	---------------------------------- BRAINSTORMING FOR THE FUTURE
	- Anonimizing
	- Brick Development Tools
		- Code Repository Integration
		- Continuous Build
			- Unit Test Execution
				- Bug Tracking Integration
			- Dependency resolution
		- Peer Grid (CPU Sharing)
		- Eclipse Integration
		  - Namespace Economy - Consider loosening TCOB1
	- Allow for "backward-compatible" interfaces with the same name
	- Allow same name from different authors
		- Author will ALWAYS use "me" as package root name. Ex: me.util.logging
			- On deployment will be replaced by the author's nickname path or id or something. Ex: fred.sister.util.logging
	- Quarantine - Option to run (only native?) components in a separate VM process to avoid crashing the system (Ex: GPF).
 	- Automated tests as part of interface spec
		- Mock Components
		- Unit Tests
			- Set of public java classes. For Each class:
				- Package name is the subject interface package appended with ".tests". Ex: me.util.logging.tests
				- Class name is the subject interface name appended with "Test". Ex: LogTest
				- Single public constructor
					- Single parameter: the instance to be tested (implements subject interface).
				- Can be used to test ALL implementations of the subject interface.


[END OF OFFICIAL TODO LIST]




OLD STUFF
=================

		- SnappPreview
			- Change size
			- Menu
				- open window
				- uninstall
				- About
				- Others (Snapp specific)
			- Sizes:
				- Single Line - Signal<String> title(). Future: space available for graphics.
				- MultiLine - Signal<int> preferredHeight() Component component(). Future: forced size by user.
				- Iconified - space available for graphics
		- SnappWindow
	- Animated collapse for SnappPreviews

	=================================================== RELEASE
	- Resizeable JWindow, instead of switching JFrame <-> JWindow.
	- Add Tab/Window Support

Container
	- replace AnnotatedFieldInjector with StaticFieldInjector which will enable removing the use of @Inject and Startable 
	- include author's pk into brick hashcode
	- use brick hashcode as key on BrickManager 
		- hash com libs
	[Almost DONE] - Brick Publish:
		1) Inform source folder (src).
		2) Inform library folder (lib).
		3) Find all interfaces that extend Brick inside src.
		4) compile the bricks using the metadatafile (describes only RELATIVE paths to libs inside lib folder) and all jars inside all subfolders of the bricks' local lib folder.
		5) Run SNEER1024 hash (SHA-512 concat Whirlpool-512) on interface .class files (or jar).
		6) Run SNEER1024 hash on impl .class files (or jar) together with libs (produce a single impl hash for it all).
		7) Inform status:
			- New brick.
			- Unchanged brick.
			- Impl changed (impl hash of brick changed)
			- Evolved brick (main interface extends main interface of old brick)
			- Invalid brick (Interface hash of brick changed)
				Deploy is not allowed in this case.
		8) deploy brick to sneer home ($USER_HOME/.sneer/)
	- Logging - Find a way that the Looger brick can configured via API without having to use the log4j properties file. 
	=================================================== RELEASE
	

Klaus
	contacts() - change from ListSignal to SetSignal.
	- Package namespace - revise sneer.lego? sneer.kernel? sneer.bricks? - Consider using kernel, pulp and skin.
	- Make build.xml run again. 
	- README.txt - Update sourcepath, classpath, main class and build.xml references
	=================================================== RELEASE
	- KeyManager <-> Mesh dependency cycle - Eliminate.
	- "Interface.allImplementors()" - Simplify use by injecting a SetSignal with all Bricks that implement a non-brick interface defined by another brick.  
	- UDP instead of TCP
