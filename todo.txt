 - Refactor: Unpollute functional.freedom* packages: move all adapter stuff to the functional.adapter package or subpackages.
 - Refactor: Move all tests that are in the form: bricks.xyz.tests.* and that depend on the implementation, to bricks.xyz.impl.tests.*. Nothing inside the brick api package or subpackages can depend on the implementation. Make interface tests abstract using the techniques you have already seen in this project. :)
 - Cleanup: Output to Console during Test Execution - Leave off by default. Tests should run clean. Turn on when needed only.
 - Serializable Instrumentation: Remove "implements Serializable" from SignalSubscription and run Freedom2Test. Make container use Bamboo's classloader contrib to fix NotSerializableException being thrown.
 - Brick Publish:
	1) Inform source folder (src).
	2) Inform library folder (lib).
	3) Find all interfaces that extend Brick inside src.
	4) compile the bricks using the metadatafile (describes only RELATIVE paths to libs inside lib folder) and all jars inside all subfolders of the bricks' local lib folder.
	5) Run SNEER1024 hash (SHA-512 concat Whirlpool-512) on interface .class files (or jar).
	6) Run SNEER1024 hash on impl .class files (or jar) together with libs (produce a single impl hash for it all).
	7) Inform status:
		- New brick.
		- Unchanged brick.
		- Impl changed (impl hash of brick changed)
		- Evolved brick (main interface extends main interface of old brick)
		- Invalid brick (Interface hash of brick changed)
			Deploy is not allowed in this case.
	8) deploy brick to sneer home ($USER_HOME/.sneer/)
 - Proactivity: Pick something from Klaus's todo list.
 

Klaus
ongoing - Component Model (see todoLego.txt)
 [DONE/revise in the future] - Exception Handler - Rename to "BlinkingLights". API must be something like turnOn("Message") returns Light, Light.turnOff(). Not just like a "logger" API.
 - Freedom2Test - Make it pass with new bricks.
 - SocketAccepter.lastAcceptedSocket() - Refactor to void acceptedSocketServer(Omnivore<ByteArraySocket>). There will only be one instead of many receivers. Simplifies the impl of SocketAccepter. 
 - Brick persistence
 - Public Keys
 - Connection Encryption
 - Auto-update of Kernel from Peers
 - Publish, Download, Auto-Update of Bricks from Peers
 - GUI - Spartan interface for what we have so far. http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SpartanUserInterface 
 - Logging - revise how logging is done by all bricks
 - Package namespace - revise sneer.lego? sneer.kernel? sneer.bricks?
 - Make build.xml run again. 
 - README.txt - Update sourcepath, classpath, main class and build.xml references
RELEASE BETA===================================================
 - Contact Navigation
 - Traffic Prioritization - Among signals and among contacts.
 - UDP instead of TCP

Gandhi
done - Make build class for Sneer
done - My Public Files Folder - Any contact can do "Save As" on the other side.
partially done (windows&konqueror not nautilus) - Public Files of Contact - Copy and Paste
 - Check file transfer between LINUX and WINDOWS. (Using Metoo, shared folders, public files).
 - Public Files of Contact - Drag and Drop
 - Persist SplitPane position (maybe with bounds)
 - Set up a gandhi.selfip.net so you are always reachable wherever you are. Tell the people on the sneercoders list.


FileSharing
  - Hardcoded directory
  - Polling
  - New file
  - Set same modified date
  - Atomic transfers always (file rename)
  - Chunked transfers.
  - File deletion detected (recover from remote)
  - Changed file (based on date)
  - File deletion requested by user (delete on both sides)
  - subdirectories
  - Limitação de uso de banda hardcoded
  - Smaller files first
  - Conflict detection
  - access control
  - File hashes to detect changes and renames
  - diff
