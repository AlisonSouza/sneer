RUNNING SNEER SOURCE CODE
=============================

http://sovereigncomputing.net/svn/sneer/ - is the Subversion (SVN) repository root. https works too. Just check out trunk/sneer.

JDK6 - Use the latest stable version of it. Before reporting bugs or problems, please make sure you are not using another JDK. To build Sneer we use the java compiler, so it has to be JDK, not the JRE.

Eclipse 3.4 or newer - You can use other IDEs but it is strongly recommended that you use Eclipse because Sneer is a self-contained Eclipse project and will compile out of the box with zero errors and zero warnings.

build.xml - If you don't use Eclipse, this ANT build file will compile Sneer and run all tests.

Main Class: main.MainDemo - Run it and follow usage instructions.

home_override - You can set this Java system property to make Sneer run in a different directory, so you can have several different Sneer installations running at the same time. Example: java -Dhome_override=some/other/directory main.MainDemo YourName

JUnit Tests - They are found inside the *.tests packages. For example, the sneer.kernel.tests package contains the JUnit tests referring to the Sneer kernel.

Functional Tests - They are JUnit tests too, but are so high-level they use adapters to run against the actual implementation. Using adapters keeps the tests clear without implementation details. These tests and their adapters are found in the ./tests/src source folder.
