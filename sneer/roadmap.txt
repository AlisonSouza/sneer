FIXES
=========

	- [Sandro] public static sneer.skin.sound.loopback.impl.Services - WTF?

	- [Klaus] Fix: Discover why tests timeout so frequently on Klaus's Linux box. Sometimes they pass in under one second, sometimes they timeout after 8 seconds. Probably has something to do with the way waiting and sleeping threads affect other threads on Linux.

	- [Sandro n Bamboo] ListSignalModel and SortedList
		- Fix: Sort Bug (see SortTest)


﻿ROADMAP TO BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE
=====================================

	- [Sandro] Sneer script - Update from SVN, compile, run. Windows and Linux. May require ANT, no problem.

	- [Sandro] ReactiveWidgetFactory - Change all Signal<String> to Signal<Object> (use toString() to display). This will allow linking number and date signals for example.

	- [Douglas] Default: Log only throwables. Have "white list" of parts of messages to log.
			- GUI to delete or add parts of messages in the "white list" to log.
			- WheelLogger
				log*()
			- Logger (pulp)
				whileList
			- Bricks to listen to EventSource Logger.loggedMessages()
				- LogToFile
				- LogToGui

	- [Bamboo] Mocotó Test Framework

	- [Klaus] ListSignal - All receivers iterate through the list as they start listening. Consider making ListSignal.addReceiver notify the receiver of all contents, just like regular Signals do.
		- SetSignal - Revise it also. 

	- [Priscila] GoBoard.countCapturedStones() - DRY

	- Gui Thread - Always call gui brick code in the gui thread. What was already done with the GuiBrickInvocationHandler does not cover callbacks. Complicated and slow weak-proxy-bubble structures would have to be created to support that. Instead, the proposed idea is:
		- [Klaus] Make the container call the gui brick constructor in the gui thread.
		- [Bamboo] Enhance at load-time the beginning of all public methods in all classes (including nested) in all gui brick impl packages, like this:
			if (!EventQueue.isDispatchThread()) {
				EventQueue.invokeAndWait(new Runnable(){public void run(){
					//recursive call to outer method with same args.
				}})
			}
			
			- Unignore and implement GuiBrickTest.guiBrickCallbacksComeInSwingThread()
			- Delete the GuiBrickInvocationHandler.
		- [Klaus] GuiBrick Javadoc - Revise.

	- Responsive threading model for instruments. They can NEVER block the Swing gui thread.
		- [Bamboo] Inspect ALL Brick bytecode at load-time and do not allow it to catch Throwable. This makes all non-blocking code stoppable. We will deal with blocking code later.
		- [Bamboo] Inspect Gui Brick bytecode at load-time and do not allow it to call any code that throws Hiccup. It is equivalent and maybe easier to simply not allow the code to catch nor throw Hiccup.

	- Output folders - Make all source folders compile to the default folder (bin) and fix the tests. Is this possible?
	
	- Revise SneerFreedom*Test classes. They are all the same

	- Simplest Possible Kernel - What is it? Just injection?
		- Simplify the container because of the removal of the Enhancer (MakeSerializable is a Spike now).
		- ASM - Move asm*.jar to a brick lib
			- Remove kernel dependency. Make it pluggable in the kernel.
	
	- Transparent Persistence

	- Snuggin - Initial rules
	
	- Revise entire project structure
		- Move or delete stuff we have not yet covered in the roadmap
			- [done] Example: Delete GiveNTake

		- Sneer
			- Installer
			- Wheel (+ Commons)
			- Boot (+ KernelJockey)
			- Kernel
			- Pulp (Bricks)
			- Skin (Bricks)
		- Snapps (Bricks)
			- ...

	- Logging - Revise all uses of logging, out and err.

	- Exception Handling - Revise and correct

	- Fix and remove all task comments in the code except for Optimize (Fix Urgent, Fix, Refactor and Implement).

	- Security - Discover if instruments can indirectly gain access to components from other instruments.


ROADMAP TO PRODUCE
======================

	- [Sandro] Contact CRUD Instrument
	
	- Flooding - Solve tuple flooding on the network. Discuss ideas with the team.
		- Traffic Prioritization by tuple type

	- [Rodrigo] Brick Publish
		- MainDemo - Publish all necessary bricks instead of just producing them.

	- Open Jar leak - Fix in Freedom7Test

	- [Petra] Tray and Dashboard Titlebar Icon
	- [Petra] Online and Offline Icons

	- Community request by Vina Callegari. He uses Eclipse 3.2.2 and it does not compile Sneer.
		- [Rodrigo] Make build.xml run MainDemo by default. Use a specific target for the Hudson build that will not run MainDemo. Coordinate with Vina (Skype: vcallegari) who said he was going to do it. He also mentioned Eclipse has an option to generate build.xml based on its project configuration, which would possibly make antlips unnecessary. Does it make sense for us to use that?
			- Name and dyndns info in propertystore.txt. Use BL to signal their absence and give instructions.

	- [Sandro] Community Initiative - Incorporate Gandhi's Google maps brick. (Run LocationGuiMain)

	
	30/JAN ---------------------------------

	- Own Name - Show contacts' names in contact list
		- Freedom2Test - Unignore and make it pass.
		
	- WatchMe
		- Accelerate.
			- Reactivate the Cache - Set WatchMeImpl.CACHE_CAPACITY to 3000 (Currently set to zero). 
			- Add a Sequencer for incoming ImageDeltaPackets.
			- Flush receiver's cache every time a packet is lost to avoid inconsistency.
				- Let peer signal interest in "lost cache packets". Do not implement this. Move this down in the roadmap when all other WatchMe tasks are done. A workaround for now is the WatchMe sender stopping and restarting WatchMe because this flushes the senders cache.

	=================================================== RELEASE
	- Resizeable JWindow, instead of switching JFrame <-> JWindow.
	- Add Tab/Window Support

Container
	- include author's pk into brick hashcode
	- use brick hashcode as key on BrickManager 
		- hash com libs
	[Almost DONE] - Brick Publish:
		1) Inform source folder (src).
		2) Inform library folder (lib).
		3) Find all interfaces that extend Brick inside src.
		4) compile the bricks using the metadatafile (describes only RELATIVE paths to libs inside lib folder) and all jars inside all subfolders of the bricks' local lib folder.
		5) Run SNEER1024 hash (SHA-512 concat Whirlpool-512) on interface .class files (or jar).
		6) Run SNEER1024 hash on impl .class files (or jar) together with libs (produce a single impl hash for it all).
		7) Inform status:
			- New brick.
			- Unchanged brick.
			- Impl changed (impl hash of brick changed)
			- Evolved brick (main interface extends main interface of old brick)
			- Invalid brick (Interface hash of brick changed)
				Deploy is not allowed in this case.
		8) deploy brick to sneer home ($USER_HOME/.sneer/)
	- Logging - Find a way that the Looger brick can configured via API without having to use the log4j properties file. 
	=================================================== RELEASE
	

Klaus
