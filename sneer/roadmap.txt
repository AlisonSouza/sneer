ROADMAP TO BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE
=====================================
[The ROADMAP TO PRODUCE is below]

	- [Rodrigo] @RunWith(JMockContainerEnvironment.class) - Use this in TestThatIsInjected so that subclasses such as MicTest don't have to declare it. Do not waste more than 30mins trying to do this.

	- [Rodrigo] @Test (expected = Exception.class) - Make our TestRunners support that. Unignore AbstractNotifierTest for example.
		- Do our test runners support timeout?

	- ContainerUtils.getContainer() - Drop. Fix all uses.

	- @Inject -> my() - Remember to stop using static fields or tests will fail wierdly.

	- [Klaus] Debugging Strategy - Revise so that all debugging info doesn't go into the log file.
		- Default: sysout and file. Filter by part of message: Only file or ignore. 

	- Mocotó Test Framework

	- ListSignal - All receivers iterate through the list as they start listening. Consider making ListSignal.addReceiver notify the receiver of all contents, just like regular Signals do.
		- SetSignal - Revise it also. 

	- Responsive threading model for snapps. Snapps can NEVER block the Swing gui thread. Maybe have one event dispatch thread per Snapp. Snapps still have to comply with invokeLater/invokeAndWait to modify gui from other threads or live with the consequences. Test to see if they can ruin/interfere with the entire Sneer gui even having acess to their own components. 

	- Output folders - Make all source folders compile to the default folder (bin) and fix the tests. Is this possible?
	
	- Revise SneerFreedom*Test classes. They are all the same

	- Simplest Possible Kernel - What is it? Just injection?
		- Simplify the container because of the removal of the Enhancer (MakeSerializable is a Spike now).
		- ASM - Move asm*.jar to a brick lib
			- Remove kernel dependency. Make it pluggable in the kernel.
	
	- Transparent Persistence

	- Snuggin - Initial rules
	
	- Revise entire project structure
		- Move or delete stuff we have not yet covered in the roadmap
			- [done] Example: Delete GiveNTake

		- Sneer
			- Installer
			- Wheel (+ Commons)
			- Boot (+ KernelJockey)
			- Kernel
			- Pulp (Bricks)
			- Skin (Bricks)
		- Snapps (Bricks)
			- ...

	- Logging - Revise all uses of logging, out and err.

	- Exception Handling - Revise and correct

	- Fix and remove all task comments in the code except for Optimize (Fix Urgent, Fix, Refactor and Implement).




ROADMAP TO PRODUCE
======================

	- [Klaus] Fix: TupleSpaceImpl.removeSubscription() is blocking the gui thread.

	- Community request by Vina Callegari. He uses Eclipse 3.2.2 and it does not compile Sneer.
		- Ask for user Name and Dyndns info using JOptionPane, if not passed as args and not persisted.
			- Persist using PropertyStore. 
		- [Rodrigo] Make build.xml run MainDemo by default. Use a specific target for the Hudson build that will not run MainDemo. 

	- [Sandro] Fix: Replace the wind list with a simple text field immediately for now. getCellRendererComponent is called for ALL elements in the list, everytime the list changes. This is causing Gui timeouts.

	- [Sandro] Fix: ArrayIndexOutOfBound (see docs/roadmap_appendices)
	
	- ListSignalModel and SortedList
		- Fix: Sort Bug (see SortTest)

	- Sequencer - Use for speextuples.
		- Configure the buffer size to the equivalent of 3 seconds to eliminate lag accumulation.

	- WatchMe
		- Accelerate.
			- BandwidthMeter instrument.      kB/s(Peak)   v 12(31)    ^ 32(41)

	2008---------------------------------- DOGFOOD RELEASE (We have a decent VNC+Skype replacement we use to develop Sneer)

	- Flooding - Solve tuple flooding on the network.
		- Traffic Prioritization by tuple type

	- Brick Publish (Supposedly working already)
		- MainDemo - Publish all necessary bricks instead of just producing them.

	- Open Jar leak - Fix in Freedom7Test

	- [Sandro] Elegance Experiment
		- Remove titles: My Contacts, Wind and Blinking Lights
		- Remove all borders: lists occupy entire instrument space. Shout edit field has no border
		- Add a good news BL: Caption: "OK", help message: "Everything is working fine. If there is a problem, you shall be notified here."

	=================================================== RELEASE
	- Resizeable JWindow, instead of switching JFrame <-> JWindow.
	- Add Tab/Window Support

Container
	- include author's pk into brick hashcode
	- use brick hashcode as key on BrickManager 
		- hash com libs
	[Almost DONE] - Brick Publish:
		1) Inform source folder (src).
		2) Inform library folder (lib).
		3) Find all interfaces that extend Brick inside src.
		4) compile the bricks using the metadatafile (describes only RELATIVE paths to libs inside lib folder) and all jars inside all subfolders of the bricks' local lib folder.
		5) Run SNEER1024 hash (SHA-512 concat Whirlpool-512) on interface .class files (or jar).
		6) Run SNEER1024 hash on impl .class files (or jar) together with libs (produce a single impl hash for it all).
		7) Inform status:
			- New brick.
			- Unchanged brick.
			- Impl changed (impl hash of brick changed)
			- Evolved brick (main interface extends main interface of old brick)
			- Invalid brick (Interface hash of brick changed)
				Deploy is not allowed in this case.
		8) deploy brick to sneer home ($USER_HOME/.sneer/)
	- Logging - Find a way that the Looger brick can configured via API without having to use the log4j properties file. 
	=================================================== RELEASE
	

Klaus
