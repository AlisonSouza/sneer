Gandhi

done - Make build class for Sneer
done - My Public Files Folder - Any contact can do "Save As" on the other side.
partially done (windows&konqueror not nautilus) - Public Files of Contact - Copy and Paste
 - Check file transfer between LINUX and WINDOWS. (Using Metoo, shared folders, public files).
 - Public Files of Contact - Drag and Drop
 - Persist SplitPane position (maybe with bounds)
 - Set up a gandhi.selfip.net so you are always reachable wherever you are. Tell the people on the sneercoders list.

 - App persistence

 - Component Model

   - Runtime
     - Hot Deploy/Undeploy
     - Interfaces - POJI (Plain Old Java Interfaces).
       - package root name is "me". Ex: me.util.logging
         - On deployment will be replaced by the author's nickname path. Ex: fred.sister.util.logging
           - "There Can Only Be One" (TCOB1) - Deployment of interfaces with same name coming from same author is not allowed.
             - Namespace Economy - Consider loosening TCOB1 in the future to allow for backward-compatible interfaces with the same name.
       - Soft Contracts - Human understandable (not deterministic) contracts. Ex: OCR.read(image) -> String (implementations can improve over time)
     - Runnable Components   
       - Life Cycle
         - Start - Constructor call 
         - Crash Only - Componentes are preemply crashed without warning.
           - Exception: Native components are notified via crash() method, for releasing system resources (Ex: file handles) in the fastest possible way (Ex: temp files are not deleted, just closed). Same behaviour as process death.
           - GC - Crashed components' classes and instances must be elligible from GC.
     - Exceptions
       - RuntimeExceptions - should be thrown only if caller violates preconditions (Ex: IllegalParameter). All other Exceptions should be checked (Ex: IO Error, Resource not found, etc). 
     
   - Management
     - Security
       - Native Components - Require JNI (Full-Trust) Security Clearance, even for verification. Warn user.
     - Quarantine - Option to run components in a separate VM process to avoid crashing the system (Ex: GPF).
     - Testing
       - Mock Components
       - Unit Tests
         - Set of public java classes. For Each class:
           - Package name is the subject interface package appended with ".tests". Ex: me.util.logging.tests
           - Class name is the subject interface name appended with "Test". Ex: LogTest
           - Single public constructor
             - First parameter is the instance to be tested (implements subject interface).
             - Subsequent parameters are dependencies to be injected.
           - Can be used to test ALL implementations of the subject interface.
         
   - Implementation
     - State Prevalence?
   
   
 - Granular profile updating per signal
 - Use TransferQueue for profile picture transfer
 - Contact Navigation


FileSharing
  - Hardcoded directory
  - Polling
  - New file
  - Set same modified date
  - Atomic transfers always (file rename)
  - Chunked transfers.
  - File deletion detected (recover from remote)
  - Changed file (based on date)
  - File deletion requested by user (delete on both sides)
  - subdirectories
  - Limitação de uso de banda hardcoded
  - Smaller files first
  - Conflict detection
  - access control
  - File hashes to detect changes and renames
  - diff
