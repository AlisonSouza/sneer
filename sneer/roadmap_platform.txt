SMALL FIXES
=============
	- Allow EventReceiver to be used with CollectionSignals too.
	
	- Timeouts - Discover why tests timeout so frequently on Klaus's Linux box. Sometimes they pass in under one second, sometimes they timeout after 8 seconds. Probably has something to do with the way waiting and sleeping threads affect other threads on Linux.

	- ListSignalModel and SortedList - Fix Sort Bug (see SortTest)

	- ListSignal - All receivers iterate through the list as they start listening. Consider making ListSignal.addReceiver notify the receiver of all contents, just like regular Signals do. See ListRegisterImpl.MyOutput._notifier
		- SetSignal - Revise it also. 

	- Revise SneerFreedom*Test classes. They are all the same


TASKS
========
	- [Sandro]Webstart

	- build.xml/Antlipse - Revive.
		- [Klaus] Eliminate upward dependencies.

	- [Bamboo]Create/Install ("publish") brick locally
		- main.Sneer - Publish all necessary bricks instead of just producing them.
			- BrickImplDirectory.isSpecialMetaInterface() - Make all those cases into annotations and delete that method.
		- Simplest Possible Kernel - What is it? Just injection?
			- Simplify the container because of the removal of the Enhancer (MakeSerializable is a Spike now) and extraction of ConventionBasedEnvironment.
			- ASM - Move asm*.jar to a brick lib
				- Remove kernel dependency. Make it pluggable in the kernel.
	
	- Output folders - Make all source folders compile to the default folder (bin) and fix the tests. Is this possible?

	- [Douglas] Logging - Default: Log only throwables. Have "white list" of parts of messages to log.
			- GUI to delete or add parts of messages in the "white list" to log.
			- Logger
				whileList
			- Bricks to listen to EventSource Logger.loggedMessages()
				- LogToFile
				- LogToGui
		- [Klaus] Transparent persistence of white list
