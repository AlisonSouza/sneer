SMALL FIXES
=============
	- ListSignalModel and SortedList - Fix Sort Bug (see SortTest)

	- ListSignal - All receivers iterate through the list as they start listening. Consider making ListSignal.addReceiver notify the receiver of all contents, just like regular Signals do. See ListRegisterImpl.MyOutput._notifier
		- SetSignal - Revise it also. 


TASKS
========
	- [Sandro] Webstart

	- [Klaus] build.xml/Antlipse - Revive.
		- Cleanup wheel
		- Eliminate upward dependencies.

	- [Klaus] Transparent persistence for bricks
		- [Sandro] WelcomeWizard should appear only if necessary. Add menu item to open it.

	- [Klaus] GuiThread - Improve how environment handling is done. 
		- Unignore GuiBrickTest.

	- [Bamboo]Create/Install ("publish") brick locally
		- Brickness - "The simplest possible container"
			- Unify the Bindings vs Contributions metaphors.
			- [Bamboo]Delete Brick interface in favor of NewBrick annotation.
			- SneerCommunity.newContainer - All that mess with StoragePath and SneerConfig is ugly.
			- Make a test run a brick in a directory that is not in the system ClassLoader classpath (Eclipse classpath). It will probably fail. Implement the logic using NewContainerImpl.createApiClassLoader() to return a URLClassloader that can be extended with new classpaths for new brick interfaces;
		
		- main.Sneer - Publish all necessary bricks instead of just producing them.
	
	- [Douglas] Logging - Default: Log only throwables. Have "white list" of parts of messages to log.
			- GUI to delete or add parts of messages in the "white list" to log.
			- Logger
				- whileList - Transient. Will be transparently persisted later on.
			- Bricks to listen to EventSource Logger.loggedMessages()
				- LogToFile
				- LogToGui
