TASKS
=========

	- [Klaus] SneerDirectories - Use them instead of hardcoded references.
		- StoragePath - Cleanup mess.

	- [Klaus] Revise entire package structure.

	- MyInfo
		- Persist
		- [Sandro] Focus on My Name Field when Sneer starts.
		
	- [Sandro] remove /sneer/src/sneer/bricks/software/bricks/finder/impl/lib/asm-all-3.1.jar and creake a ASM Brick.

	- Contact crud: persist with tuples
        
------------------------------------------ "EAT YOUR OWN DOGFOOD" RELEASE

        
	- Savepoints - For entire source code.

	- DynDns
		- Fix: Running on more than one machine will cause redundant (abusive) updates. Do not persist last discovered IP. Do a DNS lookup every time instead.
		- User data - Check if persistence is ok, in the right directory.					

	- [Igor] Daemon - Eliminate uses, especially Daemon.killAllInstances(). Find a better way. Talk to Klaus.

	- [Igor] SpeexTuplesTest - Fix intermittent failure. 	

	- [Igor] SimpleListReceiver - It cannot be public.
		- Talk to Klaus about this.
		- ListSignal - All receivers iterate through the list as they start listening. Consider making ListSignal.addReceiver notify the receiver of all contents, just like regular Signals do. See ListRegisterImpl.MyOutput._notifier
		- SetSignal - Revise it also.
		- Make a ListSignal->SetSignal adapter brick instead of SimpleListReceiver.

	- [Igor] Implement ThreadsMock sleepWithoutInterruptions
		- Make threads wait on a monitor and create other method that will notifyAll, such as wakeAllSleepers.

	- [Igor] Clean thread leaks during tests (see TestThatMightUseResources for details)
		- FYI: ThreadThatMightUseResources now waits up to 2000 millis for threads to terminate alone before killing them and printing their stack to System.err;

	- [Bamboo] Unused code:
		- GUIImpl.defineBrickMetadata param
		- ASMMetaClass

	- [Igor] SignalChoosers - Return a sneer.pulp.reactive.Reception that can de disposed, just like Signals.receive().
	
	- [Igor] Break down packages with more than one brick

	- Gui Thread - Always call gui brick code in the gui thread. What was already done with the GuiBrickInvocationHandler does not cover callbacks. Complicated and slow weak-proxy-bubble structures would have to be created to support that. Instead, the proposed idea is:
		- [Bamboo] Enhance at load-time the beginning of all public methods in all classes (including nested) in all gui brick impl packages.
			- GUI brick constructors should execute in the gui thread
			- Unignore and implement GuiBrickTest.guiBrickCallbacksComeInSwingThread()
			- Delete the GuiBrickInvocationHandler.
			- Test - Add Gui nature to gui bricks and run.
			- GuiThread - Improve how environment handling is done. 
				- Unignore GuiBrickTest.

	- [Bamboo] Create/Install ("publish") brick locally
		- Brickness - "The simplest possible container"
			- Unify the Bindings vs Contributions metaphors.
			- Unignore Freedom7 tests.
			- Make a test run a brick in a directory that is not in the system ClassLoader classpath (Eclipse classpath). It will probably fail. Implement the logic using NewContainerImpl.createApiClassLoader() to return a URLClassloader that can be extended with new classpaths for new brick interfaces;

	- [Klaus and Igor]
		- Uncomment _logger field and finalize() method in EventNotifierImpl.
		- Start breaking 'sneer.pulp' into new package structure (hardware, software, etc), and while doing that, fix packages with more than one Brick (ex: 'sneer.pulp.reactive'). 

	- DynDns
		- Simplify to remove all synchronization. Let the container synchronize the brick.
			- Concurrency - Synchronize calls on Bricks, according to docs/brick_types.txt  


	- Contact Connection
		- Own Name - Show contacts' names in contact list
			- Freedom2Test - Unignore and make it pass.
		- Public Key Ids

	- MeToo
		- Unignore Freedom7 dependency tests
		- Open Jar leak - Fix in Freedom7Test
		- Diffs

------------------------------------------ "SHARE YOUR OWN DOGFOOD" RELEASE

	- Logging - Revise all uses of logging, out and err.

	- Exception Handling - Revise and correct

	- Fix and remove all task comments in the code except for Optimize (Fix Urgent, Fix, Refactor and Implement).













TASKS
=========


		

	- Authentication (Simple)

	
	
	
	
	- Authentication (PK)


	- Responsive threading model for instruments. They can NEVER block the Swing gui thread.
		- [Bamboo] Inspect ALL Brick bytecode at load-time and do not allow it to catch Throwable. This makes all non-blocking code stoppable. We will deal with blocking code later.
		- [Bamboo] Inspect Gui Brick bytecode at load-time and do not allow it to call any code that throws Hiccup. It is equivalent and maybe easier to simply not allow the code to catch nor throw Hiccup.

	- Dashboard - Revise colors, gradient, font, size (layout). DO THIS ONLY AFTER TALKING TO KLAUS.

	- ContactsGUI - Accept cell part renderers. (dependency inverted) Discuss with team.

	- WatchMe
	- Accelerate.
		- Reactivate the Cache - Set WatchMeImpl.CACHE_CAPACITY to 3000 (Currently set to zero). 
			- Add a Sequencer for incoming ImageDeltaPackets.
			- Flush receiver's cache every time a packet is lost to avoid inconsistency.
				- Let peer signal interest in "lost cache packets". Do not implement this. Move this down in the roadmap when all other WatchMe tasks are done. A workaround for now is the WatchMe sender stopping and restarting WatchMe because this flushes the senders cache.

				- Single public constructor
					- Single parameter: the instance to be tested (implements subject interface).

Container
	- include author's pk into brick hashcode
	- use brick hashcode as key on BrickManager 
		- hash com libs
	[Almost DONE] - Brick Publish:
		1) Inform source folder (src).
		2) Inform library folder (lib).
		3) Find all interfaces that extend Brick inside src.
		4) compile the bricks using the metadatafile (describes only RELATIVE paths to libs inside lib folder) and all jars inside all subfolders of the bricks' local lib folder.
		5) Run SNEER1024 hash (SHA-512 concat Whirlpool-512) on interface .class files (or jar).
		6) Run SNEER1024 hash on impl .class files (or jar) together with libs (produce a single impl hash for it all).
		7) Inform status:
			- New brick.
			- Unchanged brick.
			- Impl changed (impl hash of brick changed)
			- Evolved brick (main interface extends main interface of old brick)
			- Invalid brick (Interface hash of brick changed)
				Deploy is not allowed in this case.
		8) deploy brick to sneer home ($USER_HOME/.sneer/)
	- Logging - Find a way that the Looger brick can configured via API without having to use the log4j properties file. 
	=================================================== RELEASE
	

Klaus
