General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Patrick =================================================

	- ScalaCompilerTest - Permgen issue. Unignore.


Kalecser =================================================

	- LogConsole filters in textfield instead of list.


Bamboo =================================================

	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"


Igor ==================================================== 

	- Smaller webstart jar
		- Send only code and compile locally.
			- bootstrap jar - add bins for foundation, compiler and builder brick
			- sneer.jar - cherry pick remove the jars duplicated in bootstrap jar
			- Installation - Unzip sneer.jar and cherry picked jars from bootstrap to SRC, use Builder brick to compile to BIN
		- After everything is working: compiler-7-ea-b17-02_aug_2007.jar - update to newer version.

	- Fix Wind's focus bug

	- Chat: instead of using JOptionPanes, extract from Wind a separate "ChatGui" brick, so that Wind and Chat can both use the same Gui.

	- Wusic - MusicalTasteMatcher Buttons - Talk to Klaus
			- First Group: (I want this track. (Today's "Me Too"))
				:D    
			- Second Group: (I dont want this particular track...)
				:)    (...but I like it. Bring me similar ones.)
				:|    (...and that's it.)
				:(    (...or any similar tracks.)

	- sovereigncomputing.net - Moralize. This is necessary to help promote Wusic.
		- Talk to Klaus 

	- New Contact Stati (Test Driven, of course)
		- Away
			- Presence detection spike based on TimeboxedEventQueue that already intercepts all gui activity. 
		- Busy


René =================================================

	- Toroidal Go Snapp


Klaus =================================================

	- InternetAddresses thread leak - Fix
		- Simplify connection
	
	- Prevalence loading impls in API classloader during tests - Fix
		- Uncomment in BrickTestRunner the following line (around line 100):  //  if (name.indexOf(".impl.")...
		- FileMapData - make static again
	
	- GUI Nature
		- [Klaus] Announce to community
	
	- OwnKeysImpl - Debug with leo and remove logging

	- Prevalence
		- ContactSeals.void put(String contactNickname, Seal seal) throws Refusal; -> PickyConsumer<Seal> sealPutterFor(Contact contact) throws Refusal;
			- Change MusicalTasteMatcher's interface to use the contact instead of the nickname (string)
		- [Igor] BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.
		- Announce to community
			- Document

	- Wusic - MusicalTasteMatcher
		- Business Logic
			- FunctionalTest not necessary. Unit test is enough because there is no remoteness going on and only a single brick is involved in the logic.

	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
