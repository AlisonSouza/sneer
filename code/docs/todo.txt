General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Kalecser =================================================

	- WindGuiImpl will no longer steal focus. If new shouts arrive and the window is not active a tray icon message will show.
	- LogConsole filters in textfield instead of list.


Bamboo =================================================

	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"


Igor ====================================================

	- Refactor PlayingTrackTest to use a mock of Attributes

	- Add task to the build's script that removes tmpFolders that weren't removed after tests

	- OwnName, OwnPort --> Attribute

	- PrettyPrinter - finish implementation. Call toString from Immutable. Call register from ContactSeals.

	- Chat
		- Fabio's One-on-one Chat - Incorporate
		- Chat Gui - Instead of using JOptionPanes, extract from Wind a separate "ChatGui" brick, so that Wind and Chat can both use the same Gui.
			- Enter bug - Fix.
			- Focus bug - Fix.

	- Wusic
		- TrackDownloader:
			- Download candidate from folder that is not being downloaded gets +0.1
			- Download candidate from peer   that is not being downloaded gets +0.1 (cumulative with folder bonus above)
		- MusicalTasteMatcher
			- FunctionalTest - Not necessary. Unit test is enough because there is no remoteness going on and only a single brick is involved in the logic.
			- Buttons - Talk to Klaus
				- First Group: (I want this track. (Today's "Me Too"))
					:D    
				- Second Group: (I dont want this particular track...)
					:)    (...but I like it. Bring me similar ones.)
					:|    (...and that's it.)
					:(    (...or any similar tracks.)

	- sovereigncomputing.net - Moralize. This is necessary to help promote Wusic.
		- Talk to Klaus 

	- New Contact Stati (Test Driven, of course)
		- Away
			- Presence detection spike based on TimeboxedEventQueue that already intercepts all gui activity. 
		- Busy


René =================================================

	- Toroidal Go Snapp
		- Unignore scoreTest


Klaus =================================================

	- Prevalence
		- Refactor Bubble
			- Reentrant Prevayler
			- Extract SimpleMethod or implement Invocation delegation along the chain.
			- immutable types
		- ContactSeals.void put(String contactNickname, Seal seal) throws Refusal; -> PickyConsumer<Seal> sealPutterFor(Contact contact) throws Refusal;
			- Change MusicalTasteMatcher's interface to use the contact instead of the nickname (string)
		- Announce to community
			- Document
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.

	- [Igor] @After are not being called by ignored tests so tmpFolder() is not being removed

	- GUI Nature
		- [Klaus] Announce to community
	
	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
