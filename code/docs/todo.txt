General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Bamboo =================================================

	- Prevalence
		- ContactSeals.void put(String contactNickname, Seal seal) throws Refusal; -> PickyConsumer<Seal> sealPutterFor(Contact contact) throws Refusal;
			- Change MusicalTasteMatcher's interface to use the contact instead of the nickname (string)
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.

Igor ====================================================

	- PlayingTrackTest
		- Make it work without holding the attribute value's signal
		- Rename this test: AttributesTest
		- Create new test using a mock of Attributes

	- OwnName, OwnPort --> Attribute<T>

	- Contact's Status
		- Create the following status:
			- Off-line
			- On-line
			- Away
			- Busy
		- Find a way to solve the problem of the menu items' order
		- Create StatusTest

	- Wusic
		- MusicalTasteMatcher Kernel
			- Implement MusicalTasteMatcherFunctionalTest
		- Nice-to-have:
			- Implement toolTip functionality for TrackDisplay._trackLabel to display the track's full name
			- Back Button
			- Find another way to solve pause lag (try to use a smaller frame in player)

	- Fix WindowBoundSetter.setBestLocation()
		- See commented lines at:
			- ContactInfoWindow
			- OwnInfo
			- BlinkingLightsGui
			- DeleteContactWindow

	- [Klaus] RapidShare Killer (Transfer Huge Files) - Do this in parallel, when you're bored of Wusic :)
		- Focus. Keep it simple. Zero sophistication. Simplest possible solution. No crash-recovery, for example. No bugs. Decent design.

René =================================================

	- Toroidal Go Snapp


Klaus =================================================

	- Refactor Bubble - immutable types

	- Seals
		- Unignore DynDnsClientTest.
		- Freedom2 - Revert old timeouts. Use pre-generated key pairs to be faster.

	- Use CustomClockTicker at SneerPartyController.accelerateHeartbeat()

	- [Igor] @After are not being called by ignored tests so tmpFolder() is not being removed

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
	
	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"
		- Announce to community

	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.
