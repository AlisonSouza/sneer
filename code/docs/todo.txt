General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Bamboo =================================================

	- Prevalence
		- Use a single prevayler for all bricks inside PrevalentImpl so that transactions are properly synchronized among all prevalent bricks.
			- Ignore method calls that are already inside a transaction context.
		- Make the Contacts brick prevalent.
			- Batism Problem - Solve. Implement "Membrane, The"
				- Talk to Klaus. Can be done using proxies exclusively or with instrumentation.
		- ContactSeals.void put(String contactNickname, Seal seal) throws Refusal; -> PickyConsumer<Seal> sealPutterFor(Contact contact) throws Refusal;
			- Change MusicalTasteMatcher's interface to use the contact instead of the nickname (string)
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.
		- Announce to community


Igor ====================================================

	- Remove warning: MainPanel(@SuppressWarnings("unused") Dimension panelSize)

	- Investigate BrickStateStoreTest

	- Contact's Status
		- Create the following status:
			- Off-line
			- On-line
			- Away
			- Busy
		- Find a way to solve the problem of the menu items' order
		- Create StatusTest
		- Refactorings:
			- Extract common structure from StatusServer, PlayingTrackServer and other similar bricks
			- Extract common structure from StatusKeeper, PlayingTrackKeeper and other similar bricks
	- Wusic
		- MusicalTasteMatcher Kernel
			- Implement MusicalTasteMatcherFunctionalTest
		- Nice-to-have:
			- Implement toolTip functionality for TrackDisplay._trackLabel to display the track's full name
			- Back Button
			- Find another way to solve pause lag (try to use a smaller frame in player)

	- Fix WindowBoundSetter.setBestLocation()
		- See commented lines at:
			- ContactInfoWindow
			- OwnInfo
			- BlinkingLightsGui
			- DeleteContactWindow

	- [Klaus] RapidShare Killer (Transfer Huge Files) - Do this in parallel, when you're bored of Wusic :)
		- Focus. Keep it simple. Zero sophistication. Simplest possible solution. No crash-recovery, for example. No bugs. Decent design.
		- Announce to community


Klaus =================================================

	- Seals
		- Generate from Public Key generated by passphrase.
		- ContactInfoWindowImpl
			- Unignore NullParameterTest and fix problem with Prevalent Nature

	- Use CustomClockTicker at SneerPartyController.accelerateHeartbeat()

	- @After are not being called by ignored tests so tmpFolder() is not being removed

	- [Rene] Dependency cycle detector.
		- Git install

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
	
	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"
		- Announce to community

	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.


Kalecser =================================================

		- Sneer "DNS".
			- Unignore ContactInternetAddressesTest
