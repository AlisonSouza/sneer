General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Bamboo =================================================

	- Prevalence
		- Use a single prevayler for all bricks inside PrevalentImpl so that transactions are properly synchronized among all prevalent bricks.
			- Ignore method calls that are already inside a transaction context.
		- Make the Contacts brick prevalent.
			- Batism Problem - Solve. Implement "Membrane, The"
				- Talk to Klaus. Can be done using proxies exclusively or with instrumentation.
		- ContactSeals.void put(String contactNickname, Seal seal) throws Refusal; -> PickyConsumer<Seal> sealPutterFor(Contact contact) throws Refusal;
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.
		- Announce to community


Igor ====================================================

	- CleanTestBase - Make sure tmp folder is being deleted.
		- Clean up System.out()'s from #tryToClean() after solving problem

	- Create functional test for Wusic
		- [Klaus] Revise changes in the classes involved in the track download scheme
			- Remove all references to Wusic from TrackDownloader
				- TrackClient should no longer be a Snapp
					- It should be activated/deactivated by Wusic's enable track download check box
					- It should in turn activate/deactivate TrackDownloader
			- Download.waitTillFinished() should throw TimeoutException
			- Download should have a method to signal if it finished successfully 

	- Submit JavaOne paper

	- Seals
		- ContactInfoWindowImpl - Contact's Seal Field: 128 bytes represented in hexadecimal that can be >entered< any old way such as copy-and-paste from an email (anything other than hex digits is ignored) but is >presented< like this:
			- ContactsSeals interface is ready to be plugged to the GUI. "Ask me how", Klaus.
				- Create a reactive component at ContactInfoWindow receiving to parameters:
					- Signals.adapt(ContactSeals.sealGiven(), functor - to convert from Seal to String)
					- new PickyConsumer<String>() that receives a String, converts to Seal, and then calls ContactsSeals.put()
			- [Klaus] Discuss with Igor refactoring of ContactsInfoWindow

	- Wusic
		- [Klaus/Daniel] MusicalTasteMatcher Kernel
		- Downloads
			- Do not download files user already has (includes peertracks) - check if it's working after the changes made to AbstractDownload
		- Nice-to-have:
			- Implement toolTip functionality for TrackDisplay._trackLabel to display the track's full name
			- Back Button 
			- Find another way to solve pause lag (try to use a smaller frame in player)

	- [Klaus] RapidShare Killer (Transfer Huge Files) - Do this in parallel, when you're bored of Wusic :)
		- Focus. Keep it simple. Zero sophistication. Simplest possible solution. No crash-recovery, for example. No bugs. Decent design.
		- Announce to community


Klaus =================================================

	- Unignore FileMapTest.rename
		- [Igor] I formatted my HD and haven't installed my Linux enviroment yet (dual boot). Can you have a look at what's happening with this test in your environment?

	- ContactSeals.ownSeal() - Extract to a new non-prevalent brick: OwnSeal.get()

	- Unignore RemoteCopyTest.testWithZeroLengthFile() - this test is the one which fails because the .part file can't be renamed backed to the original file's name
		- See this article on the Web: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6213298

	- Make Network usable
		- Sneer "DNS".

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
	
	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"
		- Announce to community

	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.
