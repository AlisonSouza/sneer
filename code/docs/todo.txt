General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Bamboo =================================================

	- Delete roadmap.txt

	- Prevalence
		- KeptTuples (Prevalent) - Take a look. See if TupleSpaceImpl._keptTuples -> my(KeptTuples.class) works.
			- Delete all other java files from the TupleSpaceImpl package.
			- Delete the lib folder from the TupleSpaceImpl package. 
		- Use a single prevayler for all bricks inside PrevalentImpl so that transactions are properly synchronized among all prevalent bricks.
			- Ignore method calls that are already inside a transaction context.
		- Make the Contacts brick prevalent. You might have to instrument creation of the Contact objects to give them an id for serialization, to avoid the baptism problem.
		- Make Seals.put() accept a Contact instead of a nickname string.
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.
		- Announce to community

	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"
		- Announce to community


Igor ====================================================

	- Don't leave dirt under the carpet
		- Unignore FileDownloadTest.receiveFileContentBlocksOutOfSequence()
		- Unignore RemoteCopyTest.testWithZeroLengthFile()

	- Runnable -> ClosureX
		- Find all places in foundation and in all our brick APIs that accept Runnable and change them to accept ClosureX.
		- Announce to community

	- @Snapp - Delete this annotation.
		- [Klaus]
			- After I deleted the @Snapp annotation, I had problems with the so called "place holder bricks", which don't have an implementation. See the list below:
				- Protocol;
				- ActionPlaceHolder;
				- ImmutableArrays;
				- ProtocolTokens;
				- BrickWithoutNature - used in tests and doesn't have impl;
				- SomeNature - used in tests and doesn't have impl;
			- We may remove the @Brick annotation from these bricks, but until we do so, I have created a new parameter for the @Brick annotation indicating if the brick has an impl (which is 'true' by default)
			- Other things to consider:
				- We may simplify the method SnappStarterImpl.isSnapp(Class<?>) depending on the decision made in the previous item
				- Reconsider the implementation of BrickFinder.findBricks()
		- [Klaus] Announce to community: do I publish at SneerCoders mailing list?

	- Seals
		- OwnInfoImpl - Add a field to show one's Seals.ownSeal().
		- ContactInfoWindowImpl - Add a field for the Contact's Seal: 128 bytes represented in hexadecimal that can be >entered< any old way such as copy-and-paste from an email (anything other than hex digits is ignored) but is >presented< like this:
			(Forget Courier. Just use default font)
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f
			- Ask Klaus for help glueing the gui to the Seals brick. Non-trivial per-contact signals and picky consumers need to be exposed in the Seals interface.  

	- Wusic
		- Find the problem with FileMap prevalence mechanism
		- Downloads
			- 15 min timeout per download.
			- Do not download files user already has (includes peertracks) - check if it's already working.
		- Contact List - Display playing track of each contact
			- Announce to community
		- [Klaus/Daniel] MusicalTasteMatcher Kernel
		- Implement toolTip functionality for TrackDisplay._trackLabel to display the track's full name
		- Back Button 
		- Find another way to solve pause lag (try to use a smaller frame in player)

	- [Klaus] RapidShare Killer (Transfer Huge Files) - Do this in parallel, when you're bored of Wusic :)
		- Focus. Keep it simple. Zero sophistication. Simplest possible solution. No crash-recovery, for example. No bugs. Decent design.
		- Announce to community



Klaus =================================================

	- Make Network usable
		- Sneer "DNS"

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
	
	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.
