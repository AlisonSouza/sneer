General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Bamboo =================================================

	- Delete roadmap.txt

	- Prevalence
		- KeptTuples (Prevalent) - Take a look. See if TupleSpaceImpl._keptTuples -> my(KeptTuples.class) works.
			- Delete all other java files from the TupleSpaceImpl package.
			- Delete the lib folder from the TupleSpaceImpl package. 
		- Use a single prevayler for all bricks inside PrevalentImpl so that transactions are properly synchronized among all prevalent bricks.
			- Ignore method calls that are already inside a transaction context.
		- Make the Contacts brick prevalent. You might have to instrument creation of the Contact objects to give them an id for serialization, to avoid the baptism problem.
		- Make Seals.put() accept a Contact instead of a nickname string.
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.

	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"
		- Announce to community


Igor ====================================================

	- Fix Sneer to run it through Java Web Start (it's not working right now: a ClassNotFoundException is being thrown)
		- Find out why SneerVersionUpdater is not being located

	- Test CPUThrottle's new implementation
		- Test if Crypto.digest(File) is working with the new implementation
		- Change Crypto.digest(File) to use a loop and CPUThrottle.yield() instead of a Stepper 

	- [Klaus] @Brick (isSnapp = true)
		- What do you prefer @Snapp or the attribute shown above?
			- I like the attribute because it makes clear that a Snapp is also a brick
		- Reconsider the implementation of BrickFinder.findBricks() - it still uses ASM
		- Announce to community: do I publish the new approach at SneerCoders mailing list?

	- Seals
		- ContactInfoWindowImpl - Add a field for the Contact's Seal: 128 bytes represented in hexadecimal that can be >entered< any old way such as copy-and-paste from an email (anything other than hex digits is ignored) but is >presented< like this:
			(Forget Courier. Just use default font)
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f     
			12ab 12ab 21ab 21f4 2e44 2a34 1c34 123f
			- Ask Klaus for help glueing the gui to the Seals brick. Non-trivial per-contact signals and picky consumers need to be exposed in the Seals interface.  

	- Wusic
		- Contact List - Display playing track of each contact
			- [Klaus] Revise first draft's architecture - package 'dfcsantos.tracks.sharing.playingtracks'
			- Announce to community
		- [Klaus/Daniel] MusicalTasteMatcher Kernel
		- Downloads
			- 15 min timeout per download.
			- Do not download files user already has (includes peertracks) - check if it's already working.
		- Implement toolTip functionality for TrackDisplay._trackLabel to display the track's full name
		- Back Button 
		- Find another way to solve pause lag (try to use a smaller frame in player)

	- [Klaus] RapidShare Killer (Transfer Huge Files) - Do this in parallel, when you're bored of Wusic :)
		- Focus. Keep it simple. Zero sophistication. Simplest possible solution. No crash-recovery, for example. No bugs. Decent design.
		- Announce to community



Klaus =================================================

	- Unignore RemoteCopyTest.testWithZeroLengthFile() - this test is the one which fails because the .part file can't be renamed backed to the original file's name
		- See this article on the Web: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6213298

	- Make Network usable
		- Sneer "DNS".

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
	
	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.
