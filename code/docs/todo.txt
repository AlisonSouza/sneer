General Direction:
	1) To ENABLE users to develop and share bricks.
	2) To MOTIVATE users to develop bricks by fostering a growing user-base through interesting snapps such as media sharing (Wusic, Movies, etc). Better ideas of cool easy-kill snapps are welcome.

Following are the tasks each one of us has on his plate right now:


Bamboo =================================================

	- Prevalence
		- Use a single prevayler for all bricks inside PrevalentImpl so that transactions are properly synchronized among all prevalent bricks.
			- Ignore method calls that are already inside a transaction context.
		- Make the Contacts brick prevalent.
			- Batism Problem - Solve. Implement "Membrane, The"
				- Talk to Klaus. Can be done using proxies exclusively or with instrumentation.
		- ContactSeals.void put(String contactNickname, Seal seal) throws Refusal; -> PickyConsumer<Seal> sealPutterFor(Contact contact) throws Refusal;
		- BrickStateStore: retire. Use the prevalent nature instead.
		- Announce to community


Igor ====================================================

	- Check if unit tests are crashing the threads of all environments created by them
		- Discuss with Klaus:
			- Where to put method #crash(Environment) without creating circular dependencies
				- See changes made to 'BrickTestWithThreads' and 'BrickTest'
			- Extraction of method #runInNewEnvironment(Closure) to a base class (see TuplePersistenceTest for reference)
			- The implementation of the following classes:
				- GUINatureTest
				- EnvironmentsTest
				- ContinuationBenchmark (it's used by no one)

	- Create functional test for Wusic
		- Wusic.switchOperatingMode() --> Wusic.setOperatingMode()

	- Discuss with Klaus the possibility of making Download's interface simpler

	- Submit JavaOne paper

	- Seals
		- ContactInfoWindowImpl - Contact's Seal Field: 128 bytes represented in hexadecimal that can be >entered< any old way such as copy-and-paste from an email (anything other than hex digits is ignored) but is >presented< like this:
			- ContactsSeals interface is ready to be plugged to the GUI. "Ask me how", Klaus.
				- Create a reactive component at ContactInfoWindow receiving two parameters:
					- Signals.adapt(ContactSeals.sealGiven(), functor - to convert from Seal to String)
					- new PickyConsumer<String>() that receives a String, converts to Seal, and then calls ContactsSeals.put()
			- [Klaus] Discuss with Igor refactoring of ContactsInfoWindow

	- Wusic
		- [Klaus/Daniel] MusicalTasteMatcher Kernel
		- Downloads
			- Do not download files user already has (includes peertracks) - check if it's working after the changes made to AbstractDownload
		- Nice-to-have:
			- Implement toolTip functionality for TrackDisplay._trackLabel to display the track's full name
			- Back Button 
			- Find another way to solve pause lag (try to use a smaller frame in player)

	- [Klaus] RapidShare Killer (Transfer Huge Files) - Do this in parallel, when you're bored of Wusic :)
		- Focus. Keep it simple. Zero sophistication. Simplest possible solution. No crash-recovery, for example. No bugs. Decent design.
		- Announce to community

	- Configure Hudson:
		- Fix Sneer-Clover
		- So it doens't start a new build when only non-source files are changed (ex: changes in todo.txt)
			- One simple way of bulking out builds is to enable a "quiet period" - a newly scheduled build waits for X seconds before actually being built
		- Set up Hudson to run PMD - Programming Mistake Detector (http://pmd.sourceforge.net)

Klaus =================================================

	- Unignore RemoteCopyTest.testWithZeroLengthFile() - this test is the one which fails because the .part file can't be renamed backed to the original file's name
		- See this article on the Web: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6213298

	- [Rene] Dependency cycle detector.

	- Make Network usable
		- Sneer "DNS".

	- Freedom7 - "Me Too" for Bricks 
		- Unignore Freedom7.meToo
			- BrickSpaceImpl.init() uncomment.
			- BrickInstallerTest
			- LocalBrickDiscoveryTest unignore.
		- Brick States - All
			- Hierarchical View - Consider groups of bricks (brick package at any level, examples: bricks.hardware, bricks.software, bricks.hardware.io, etc) as an optional grouping for versioning and downloading from friends, not only individual bricks.
				- Do not allow circular dependencies among any level of groups of bricks and voila: the world is free of cyclic dependencies.
	
	- GUI Nature
		- "Finish Him"
		- Announce to community

	- Revise entire package structure.
		- Remove all calls to Thread.sleep() including indirect.
