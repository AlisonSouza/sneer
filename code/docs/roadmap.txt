The roadmap is no more. :) It has undergone a major cleanup.

Most of it was deleted under the belief that if something is
really important, Sneer users (including ourselves) will not
let us forget it. 

A few things, with more elaborate analysis, were moved to
docs/future_ideas.

Our current tasks are in docs/todo.txt.
